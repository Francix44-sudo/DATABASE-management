Hello, 👋 there, welcome to my DATABASE MANAGEMENT REPO!..
I'll highly recommend it if you are a beginner 🤏, an intermediate 👌, or even a senior 🤟..brushing up your skills matters too..😄
This repo contains files for performing CRUD(Create, Read, Update and Delete) operations in a shop's database.
The databse is a store house for keeping track of the goods in stock, the prices, and the product name too.
An update of extending it 🚀..by making sales decisions🧑 and graphically viewing the stock availability and price change with variance is on the way
But the updates will be integrated using an API.
Thanks guys for stoping by🤠..can't wait for corrections and contributions from anyone who is wiling to.💠
